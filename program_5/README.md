  In this program, the data is pulled and displayed as ten items per page. Total number of pages is calculated based on the total available products in the data base. Each time a page number is clicked, the program gets the required data from the database.
Another feature added is when a column heading is clicked all the items are sorted ascedingly or descendingly.
